## 🧪 Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Run all Playwright tests (headless)
npm test

# Run in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Generate Allure report
npm run allure:generate

# Open Allure report in browser
npm run allure:open
```

---

## 🐳 Running Tests in Docker

Build and run tests in a Docker container (as in CI):

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-playwright-runner -f DockerFile.playwright .

# Run tests (Allure report will be generated inside the container)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/allure-report:/app/allure-report my-playwright-runner npm run test:allure
```

- On every push to `main`, `qa`, `dev`, or any `feature/*` branch
- On every pull request to those branches
- Manually via workflow dispatch

### 📁 Workflow Location

```
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
```

### 🐳 Docker in CI

- Builds and runs tests inside a Docker container for consistency
- Generates and uploads Allure reports as CI artifacts

### 📂 CI Artifacts
